 uma cena simples feita no Unity.
 
cena 1:
Diogo: What's up, Gustavo! I'm fine, man. And you?

cena 2:
Diogo: Oh, yes! I've also heard of this fund. It has a good opinion and offers a stable monthly income.

Diogo: That sounds like a good investment. But have you analyzed the earnings history of this fund?

Diogo: Great! And what is the average redemption period for these shares?

cena 3:
Besides the monthly income, is there any other advantage in investing in the MXRF11?

That's great! With monthly income and the possibility of appreciation, it seems to be a good strategy to diversify our investments.

cena 4:
Absolutely! Let's calculate the amounts and check if we can invest together.

Diogo: Great! I will wait for your call. I think we are on the right track to achieve our financial goals.

cena 5:
Diogo: Yes, Gustavo! Now I have to go, I have things to do. See you later
